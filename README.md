# M-Club Flutter Starter Template

This is a minimal starter scaffold for the M-Club mobile application (Flutter).
It contains pre-defined folders and simple placeholder screens for the features
described in the ТЗ (ТЗ_MClub_v4.docx).

## How to use

1. Copy this folder into your Flutter workspace, or open it in Android Studio / VS Code.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Run on an emulator or device: `flutter run`.

## Project structure (key folders)

- lib/
  - main.dart         -- app entry
  - app.dart          -- MaterialApp, router placeholder
  - core/             -- constants, services, widgets
  - features/         -- auth, mclub, uae_unlocked, radio, news, home
  - l10n/             -- localization arb files

This template is purposely minimal and intended as a starting point.
